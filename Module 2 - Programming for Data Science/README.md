# 📊 Exploratory Analysis of COVID-19 Related Questions on Social Media

## 🧠 Overview

During the COVID-19 outbreak, Latin America was one of the most affected regions, with **Brazil being the hardest hit**. 

Social media platforms such as **Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram** became key sources for observing public behavior, concerns, and especially **questions and uncertainties** in real time. This project aims to leverage this information to **support public decision-making** during the pandemic.

Our focus is on data from **Twitter**, a platform known for its high volume and frequent information exchange, similar to **Weibo**, widely used in China. 

> 🎯 The main goal is to conduct an **exploratory analysis of COVID-19-related questions posted by users on Twitter**, identifying patterns and changes over time and across regions.

## 🎯 Objectives

- 📌 Present and explore samples of the collected data;
- 🤖 Extract and classify questions from tweets;
- 🧾 Generate a dataset called `duvidasDb` with the extracted questions;
- 📊 Analyze the questions from multiple perspectives:

### 🔍 Data Overview
- Summary with the statistics of the original data, i.e. without any pre-processing;
- Statistics can be presented through tables and/or graphs.

### 📚 Question Classification
- Identify types of questions related to:
  - Diseases - When the question is about the disease. It should be noted that the disease is identified by several names. Example: coronavirus, corona, COVID-19, etc.
  - Medications - When the question is about the use of a certain medication in the treatment of the disease.
  - Organizations - When the question is about a certain entity or organization. TV stations, the Ministry of Health or companies are examples of organizations.
  - People - When the question is about a certain person. For example, the question may be about the actions of a certain politician or famous person during this pandemic period.

### ⏳ Temporal Analysis
- You can consider the time interval of days, weeks or months;
- Perform a temporal analysis of the questions that make up the dataset. Example:
  - Has there been an increase in the number of questions over time?
  - Has the profile of the questions changed over time?

### 🗺️ Geographic Analysis
- A geographic (spatial) analysis of the questions that make up the dataset should be performed;
- Example of geographic analysis:
  - a) Do users from different regions ask questions with different focuses?
- This analysis can also be performed at different levels of area (city, state or region);
- Present the distribution of user questions by region;
- An analysis of this distribution should be performed. Example:
  - Present the reasons (or hypotheses) for the occurrence of this distribution.
